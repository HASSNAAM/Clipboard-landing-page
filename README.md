## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

In this project, I learned to effectively utilize semantic HTML5 elements to improve the accessibility and structure of the web page. I also refined my skills in CSS custom properties, Flexbox for responsive design. Here are some code snippets that I am proud of:

```html
<section>
  <h2>Keep track of your snippets</h2>
  <p>Clipboard instantly stores any item you copy in the cloud, meaning you can access your snippets immediately on all your devices. Our Mac and iOS apps will help you organize everything.</p>
</section>
```
```css
button {
  border-radius: 30px;
  padding: 18px 45px;
  border: none;
  outline: none;
  font-weight: bolder;
  color: #fff;
  cursor: pointer;
  transition: opacity 0.3s ease-in-out;
}

button:first-child {
  margin-right: 20px;
  background-color: var(--Strong-Cyan);
  box-shadow: 0 9px 14px hsla(171, 66%, 44%, 0.31);
  border-bottom: 4px groove hsla(171, 66%, 44%, 0.6);
}

button:last-child {
  background-color: var(--Light-Blue);
  box-shadow: 0 9px 14px hsla(233, 100%, 69%, 0.481);
  border-bottom: 2px groove hsla(233, 100%, 69%, 0.9);
}

button:hover {
  opacity: 0.8;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
### Continued development

In future projects, I want to focus on improving the accessibility of my web pages by ensuring that all interactive elements are keyboard navigable and have appropriate ARIA labels. I also plan to explore more advanced CSS techniques, such as CSS animations and transitions, to enhance the user experience.
